# 2024 Year in Rebrew

This website is a look back on 2024 for members of [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk)'s [Coffee Club](https://coffee.openlab.dev).
It is a static website, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), styled with [Alembic](https://alembic.openlab.dev) and using fonts from [Open Lab Fonts](https://fonts.openlab.dev).
Pages are generated with a unique hash for each user so it is up to members to share their individual pages if they like.

**notes**

- Can alembic be done with Webc components?
- Sharp doesn't like hub SVGs ~ https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1996
  for 2024, I built the site and manually swapped the broken headshots before
  building the docker container
