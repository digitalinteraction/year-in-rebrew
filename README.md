# 2023 Year in Rebrew

This website is a look back on 2023 for members of [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk)'s [Coffee Club](https://coffee.openlab.dev).
It is a static website, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), styled with [Alembic](https://alembic.openlab.dev) and using fonts from [Open Lab Fonts](https://fonts.openlab.dev).
Pages are generated with a unique hash for each user so it is up to members to share their individual pages if they like.
